Hello Prof. Phoulady,

I forgot to ask you to sign me up for the Master's Project class.  I decided to sign up for it since I realized I will not actually have two classes this semester, I looked at the requirements and I only need the Master's Project and one other class (which is also taught by you!).  I have attached a screenshot that shows what it looks like when I try to sign up for the class.  I would like to have this done by next Friday, 2/5.

I labeled a test image for the cytology dataset and have attached a screenshot below.  Let me know if
it looks okay.
